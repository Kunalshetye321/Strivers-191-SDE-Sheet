We will run a loop(say i) from 1 to N.
For each integer, i, we will count its occurrence in the given array using linear search.
We will store those two elements that have the occurrence of 2 and 0.
Finally, we will return the elements.

(Using math)

First, find out the values of S and Sn and then calculate S – Sn (Using the above formulas).
Then, find out the values of S2 and S2n and then calculate S2 – S2n.
After performing steps 1 and 2, we will be having the values of X + Y and X – Y. Now, by substitution of values, we can easily find the values of X and Y.
